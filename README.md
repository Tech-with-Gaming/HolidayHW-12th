# Computer Science Holiday Homework - 12th Grade

A comprehensive Python project containing solutions to various Computer Science programming problems, focusing on data structures, string manipulation, and algorithmic problem-solving.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project contains 14 Python functions that solve different programming challenges covering:
- List and tuple manipulation
- Dictionary operations
- String processing
- Mathematical computations
- Data structure operations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ (uses match-case statements)
- No external dependencies required

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tech-with-Gaming/HolidayHW-12th.git
cd HolidayHW-12th
```

2. Run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```

## 📖 Available Functions

### List Operations
- **ans1** - Swap list elements with next divisible by 5
- **ans11** - Multiply all items in a list
- **ans12** - Find smallest number from a list
- **ans13** - Append one list to another
- **ans14** - Generate squares and display first/last 5 elements
- **ans24** - Find largest number from a list

### Tuple Operations
- **ans2** - Accept user tuple, add to predefined tuple, show min/max
- **ans3** - Input two tuples, interchange and compare them

### Dictionary Operations
- **ans4** - Store classes and teachers, lookup by class
- **ans5** - Store student names/percentages, delete entries
- **ans17** - Check if key exists in dictionary

### String Operations
- **ans6** - Capitalize first and last letters of string
- **ans7** - Remove duplicate characters from string
- **ans8** - Compute sum of digits in string
- **ans9** - Find second most repeated word

## 🎯 Usage

Run the program and enter the function name when prompted:

```bash
python main.py
```

Example:
```
Enter the function name to run: ans1
[25, 3, 13, 35, 6, 8, 45, 14]

ans1() Function gives output in int form.
lis is the list which contains all numbers, loop runs from 0, 7.
Condition is checked if the next number is divisible by 5.
If yes, then nums are swapped.
```

## 📝 Problem Descriptions

1. **List Swapping**: Swap elements with next value divisible by 5
2. **Tuple Operations**: User input tuple manipulation with statistics
3. **Tuple Interchange**: Input, swap, and compare two tuples
4. **Class-Teacher Dictionary**: Store and lookup class-teacher relationships
5. **Student Records**: Manage student names and percentages with deletion
6. **String Capitalization**: Capitalize first and last characters
7. **Duplicate Removal**: Remove duplicate characters from strings
8. **Digit Sum**: Calculate sum of all digits in a string
9. **Word Frequency**: Find repeated words in text
10. **List Product**: Multiply all elements in a list
11. **Minimum Value**: Find smallest number in a list
12. **List Extension**: Append one list to another
13. **Square Generation**: Generate squares and display specific elements
14. **Dictionary Key Check**: Verify if key exists in dictionary
15. **Maximum Value**: Find largest number in a list

## 🛠️ Code Structure

The project follows a clean structure with:
- Individual functions for each problem
- Comprehensive docstrings for documentation
